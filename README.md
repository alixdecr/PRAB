# PRAB
Public REST API Benchmark (PRAB). This GitHub repository contains the OpenAPI documentation for various REST APIs.

## Main Goal
The main goal of this repository is to provide a public benchmark of REST APIs, for the evaluation of research related to REST APIs. For instance, a new testing tool can leverage the OpenAPI specifications provided in this repository.

## Content
At the moment, each REST API of the benchmark has its folder, containing an available (and up-to-date) OpenAPI specification (JSON or YAML format).

## Acknowledgements
A special thanks to Dr. Andrea Arcuri (arcuri82 on GitHub), who provided a lot of publicly accessible OpenAPI specifications. Indeed, a lot of OpenAPI specifications were found on the EvoMaster Benchmark (EMB) GitHub repository: https://github.com/WebFuzzing/EMB
