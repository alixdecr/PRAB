The API follows the ISO standard for defining countries, and the filtering works best when using the corresponding ISO code of the country.\n  <aside class=\"note\"><strong>Note</strong>: If you receive unexpected results with a country code, verify that you are using a code which includes the countries, dependent territories, and special areas of geographical interest you intend. You can find code information at Wikipedia: List of ISO 3166 country codes or the ISO Online Browsing Platform.</aside>\n  \nThe following components may be used to influence results, but will not be enforced:\n\n* `route` matches the long or short name of a route.\n* `locality` matches against `locality` and `sublocality` types.\n* `administrative_area` matches all the `administrative_area` levels.\n  \nNotes about component filtering:\n\n* Do not repeat these component filters in requests, or the API will return `INVALID_REQUEST`: \n  * `country`\n  * `postal_code`\n  * `route`\n* If the request contains repeated component filters, the API evaluates those filters as an AND, not an OR.\n* Results are consistent with Google Maps, which occasionally yields unexpected `ZERO_RESULTS` responses. Using Place Autocomplete may provide better results in some use cases. To learn more, see [this FAQ](https://developers..google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/faq#trbl_component_filtering).\n* For each address component, either specify it in the address parameter or in a components filter, but not both. Specifying the same values in both may result in `ZERO_RESULTS`.\n\n<div class=\"note\">Note: At least one of `address` or `components` is required.</div>",

All other addresses are returned in the preferred language.

				"description": "The Geocoding API is a service that provides geocoding and reverse geocoding of addresses.\n\n**Geocoding** is the process of converting addresses (like a street address) into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.\n\n**Reverse geocoding** is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address.\n\nYou can also use the Geocoding API to find the address for a given place ID.\n\nTo see countries currently supported by the Google Maps Platform Geocoding API, please consult the [Google Maps coverage data](https://developers.google.com/maps/coverage). The accuracy of geocoded locations may vary per country, so you should consider using the returned `location_type` field to determine if a good enough match has been found for the purposes of your application. Please note that the availability of geocoding data depends on our contracts with data providers, so it is subject to change."
